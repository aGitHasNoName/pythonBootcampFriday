# Python Fundamentals Bootcamp Friday

On the last day of the bootcamp, there is no homework, only the lecture notebook, fridayLecture.ipynb.

This lesson covers some of the built-in Python objects we didn't get to during the first three days of the workshop: tuples, sets, and ranges, as well as conditional functions that you can use in your if statements. The lesson ends with a very brief introduction to the Pandas package for working with data shaped in rows and columns (but for a complete workshop on basic Pandas, see [Next Steps in Python: Data Science Basics](https://github.com/aGitHasNoName/dataScienceBasics).

#### To run the Friday lecture notebook on your own computer:
Click on the green Code button above and choose Download Zip. Unzip the folder on your computer. Open Jupyter Lab (through the Anaconda Navigator or through the command line). In the file tree on the left side of the screen, navigate to the folder you just downloaded and open the lecture notebook.
